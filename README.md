# pybot
Just something I built off of a couple youtube tutorials

# Thur 30, 2017 First upload

# Thur 30, 2017 Updated Help command

# Installation
So pretty much just clone and "python3 bot.py" this thing
in the terminal or however you do it. Don't forget to change
the info in "secrets.py" so that your token is in there etc.
