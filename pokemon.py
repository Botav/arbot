'''
Okay this class allows you to call !wtp from chat
A random pokemon will appear as a silhouetted bitmap and then users
will get some time to guess the pkmn before the time is up.

Upon a correct guess or when the time runs out, the correct pokemon 
will display with the corresponding win or loss message.

Features might include something that lets you guess from a 
specific gen of pokemon rather than all of them. For nows we will
only include gen one

Design flow:
    1. user launches command
    2. bot generates a random number (pokemon)
    3. bot displays the silloetted image of the pokemon to client
    4. user attempts to guess pokemon name
    5. bot compares the name to the database
    6. if correct or out of time move on - else repeat 4 & 5
    7. display correct image and appropriate win/lose text
